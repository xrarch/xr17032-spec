# REGISTERS

&nbsp;  


The XR/17032 processor architecture contains 32 GPRs (general-purpose registers), and 16 CRs (control registers).

## Control Registers
For control registers, there are 2 instructions, `MTCR` and `MFCR`, that alter the control registers, and for these 2 instructions the control registers are encoded in 4 bits of the opcode. The `TBLO` and `TBINDEX` control registers specifically are modified by the `TBRD` and `TBFN` instructions.

| Name       | Encoding | Description
| ---------- | -------- | -----------
| RS         | 0000     | Processor Status
| TBLO       | 0010     | TLB Entry

| TBSCRATCH  | 1010     | TLB Miss Scratch
| TBHI       | 1011     | ASID & TLB Miss Address
| K0         | 1100     | 
| K1         | 1101     | 
| K2         | 1110     | 
| K3         | 1111     | 

## General Purpose Registers

General purpose registers are encoded with 5 bits in instruction opcodes using registers.

| Name       | Encoding    | Description
| ---------- | ----------- | ----------
| ZERO       | 00000       Zero Register: always reads zero, ignores writes.
| T0         | 00001       | 
| T1         | 00010       | 
| T2         | 00011       | 
| T3         | 00100       | 
| T4         | 00101       | 
| T5         | 00110       | 
| A0         | 00111       | 
| A1         | 01000       | 
| A2         | 01001       |

# OPCODES

&nbsp;  

## Example - EX imm16

&nbsp;  

`nnnn nnnn nnnn nnnn ssss sddd dd11 1100`

&nbsp;  


This is where the full English explanation of an opcode goes. 



&nbsp;  

### Implementation

```

// put the exact code of how its implemented in xremu here. md.py adds backticks.


```

### Notes



Any auxiliary notes (such as referring to other opcodes or document sections) goes here.

This is the only optional opcode toml key.



&nbsp;  

## Example 2 - EX2 imm16

&nbsp;  

`nnnn nnnn nnnn nnnn ssss sddd dd11 1111`

&nbsp;  


This is where the full English explanation of an opcode goes. 



&nbsp;  

### Implementation

```

// put the exact code of how its implemented in xremu here. md.py adds backticks.


```

### Notes



Any auxiliary notes (such as referring to other opcodes or document sections) goes here.

This is the only optional opcode toml key.
